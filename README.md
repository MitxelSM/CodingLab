# 👨‍💻 coding-lab

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to my personal coding lab.  
This repo is where I practice, experiment, and keep learning different programming languages.

It’s a mix of exercises, small challenges, and personal notes — all part of building a solid foundation as I work toward a career in DevOps and SRE.

## 🎯 Why this repo?

Because the best way to learn how to code… is by coding.  
Here, I keep:

- Practice exercises to understand syntax and logic  
- Challenges from tutorials, courses, or personal ideas  
- Mini projects that help me explore concepts  
- Handy scripts and notes for future reference

## 🗂️ Structure

Each language has its own folder:

/python\n
/php\n
/bash\n
/javascript\n
/java


Inside each folder, you’ll find files organized by topic, difficulty, or date.
