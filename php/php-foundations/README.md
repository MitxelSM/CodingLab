# PHP Foundations

This folder contains basic PHP exercises focused on learning and practicing fundamental programming concepts such as:

- Conditionals (`if`, `switch`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`, `foreach`)
- Arrays (indexed and associative)
- Basic logic structures

Each exercise is named using the format `YYYY-MM-DD-title.php` to keep things organized chronologically.

Learning how to use these foundational skills is essential before working on more complex projects.
